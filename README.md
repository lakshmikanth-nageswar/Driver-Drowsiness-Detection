Run Drowsiness_Detection.py file , it is the code for the project.

Important note :

Models folder should contain data file of size 90MB. Unable to upload that file to github , so Iam attaching drive link for entire folder here. Just download that folder and run the file 
"Drowsiness_Detection.py". It gives you the result of project.
Thank you.
